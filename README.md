# kyu ✨
a WhatsApp bot that converts images into stickers built with [wwebjs](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js).

## just... why? 🤔
the bot that i used just stopped working, so i decided to create another one. it turned out to be pretty okay, so i uploaded it to GitHub!

## okay... how do i use it? 😯
1. first, clone the repository on your machine using `git clone https://github.com/zuukynn/kyu-bot.git`.
2. install the project's dependencies using `npm install`.
3. customize the `./lang.json` and `./config.json` files in order to fit your needs, the keys are pretty self-explanatory. in `config.json`, you **have** to start the commands using a slash `/`.
4. run `npm run start` and link your device using the QR code that's going to appear on your terminal. [click here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1317564962315842/?cms_platform=web) if you don't know how to link a device.
5. that's it! now you have a bot in your WhatsApp account.

## do you plan on updating it? 🧐
~~if i ever need to, yeah. maybe i will add video and gif support, which shouldn't be hard at all.~~ added! _(although i must say it was NOT easy...)_

## may i contribute? 🤓
sure! just fork the project and open a PR and i will analyze it myself. i appreciate the help!

## anything else? 😥
no. thanks for reading!
